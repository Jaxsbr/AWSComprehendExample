# AWSComprehendExample

I've always been interested in AI system like Jarvis in the movie Iron Man where Tony tells is something simple and it then goes and performs a rather difficult task in the background on his behalve.
e.g. Hey Jarvis, start a new project and call it Iron Suit.

In this repository I demonstrate how to use AWS Comprehend to extract the neccesary information needed from a sentence to determine what type of `dotnet` project to create.

## Prerequisites

- AWS billing account
- awscli profile configuration
